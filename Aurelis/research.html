            <h2>Some scientific articles written by me</h2>

            <p>
                Here are some articles written by me. They are very scientific, 'heavy stuff'. Among other things, they show that a lot is already known scientifically, a lot is not. Most of all, most of what is known doesn't reach the normal practise of medicine, neither the general public...
                <br>
                <br>Still, it is of course incredibly important.
                <br>
                <br>Have a good read, if you like a challenge. If you are a colleague, feel free to respond with in-depth commentary.

            <h2>Science by others</h2>
            <h3>Science about the mind-body connection</h3>
            <p>In this section, some scientific articles are discussed that are revealing for the mind-body connection. The articles are all from very highly regarded scientific magazines. References are always provided.
                <br>This is not an extensive list. There is much more extremely interesting research out there about many related subjects. I will regularly augment this section with new material. In case you know of some other ery interesting published research, please tell us. Thanks!

            <h3>Asthmatic Children</h3>
            <p>A pilot study in Venezuela on 35 asthmatic children shows that 6 months of psychosocial intervention, teaching them relaxation, guided imagery and self esteem techniques, created impressive reduction in their asthmatic reactions. Nineteen children were assigned to the intervention group, and 16 to the control condition. Both groups received conventional treatment. During the 6 months of the study, the intervention group experienced significantly fewer asthmatic episodes, less use of bronchodilator medication and improved pulmonary function when compared with 6 months before the intervention. In addition, this group had a significant reduction in IgE responses against primary allergens, an increase in NK (natural killer) cells, along with other impressive changes in surface markers - in fact, these became similar to those of non-asthmatic kids from the same vicinity. None of these changes were seen in the controls.</p>
            <p id="source-quote">Article reference: Castes M, Hagel I, Palenque M, Canelones P, Corao A, Lynch N. Immunological Changes Associated with Clinical Improvement of Asthmatic Children Subjected to Psychological Invention. Brain, Behavior and Immunity; 13, 1-3, 1999.

            <h3>BULIMIA NERVOSA.</h3>
            <p>A randomized controlled trial compared a group of bulimic patients receiving 6 weeks of individual guided imagery therapy with a control group receiving standard care. Fifty participants who met the criteria for bulimia nervosa completed the study. Measures of eating disorder symptoms, psychological functioning and the response to the guided imagery experience were used. The guided imagery treatment substantially reduced bingeing and purging episodes; the imagery group had a 74% mean reduction of bingeing and a 73% reduction of vomiting. The imagery treatment also demonstrated improvement in attitudes about eating, dieting and body weight in comparison to the control group. In addition, the guided imagery group demonstrated improvement on psychological measures of aloneness and the ability for self-comforting. The study concludes that guided imagery is an effective treatment for bulimia nervosa, at least in the short-term.</p>
