            <h2>Some scientific articles written by me</h2>

            <p>
                Here are some articles written by me. They are very scientific, 'heavy stuff'. Among other things, they show that a lot is already known scientifically, a lot is not. Most of all, most of what is known doesn't reach the normal practise of medicine, neither the general public...
                <br>
                <br>Still, it is of course incredibly important.
                <br>
                <br>Have a good read, if you like a challenge. If you are a colleague, feel free to respond with in-depth commentary.

            <h2>Science by others</h2>
            <h3>Science about the mind-body connection</h3>
            <p>In this section, some scientific articles are discussed that are revealing for the mind-body connection. The articles are all from very highly regarded scientific magazines. References are always provided.
                <br>This is not an extensive list. There is much more extremely interesting research out there about many related subjects. I will regularly augment this section with new material. In case you know of some other ery interesting published research, please tell us. Thanks!

            </p>
            <h3>Asthmatic Children</h3>
            <p>A pilot study in Venezuela on 35 asthmatic children shows that 6 months of psychosocial intervention, teaching them relaxation, guided imagery and self esteem techniques, created impressive reduction in their asthmatic reactions. Nineteen children were assigned to the intervention group, and 16 to the control condition. Both groups received conventional treatment. During the 6 months of the study, the intervention group experienced significantly fewer asthmatic episodes, less use of bronchodilator medication and improved pulmonary function when compared with 6 months before the intervention. In addition, this group had a significant reduction in IgE responses against primary allergens, an increase in NK (natural killer) cells, along with other impressive changes in surface markers - in fact, these became similar to those of non-asthmatic kids from the same vicinity. None of these changes were seen in the controls.</p>
            <p id="source-quote">Article reference: Castes M, Hagel I, Palenque M, Canelones P, Corao A, Lynch N. Immunological Changes Associated with Clinical Improvement of Asthmatic Children Subjected to Psychological Invention. Brain, Behavior and Immunity; 13, 1-3, 1999.
            </p>
            <h3>Bulimia Nervosa</h3>
            <p>A randomized controlled trial compared a group of bulimic patients receiving 6 weeks of individual guided imagery therapy with a control group receiving standard care. Fifty participants who met the criteria for bulimia nervosa completed the study. Measures of eating disorder symptoms, psychological functioning and the response to the guided imagery experience were used. The guided imagery treatment substantially reduced bingeing and purging episodes; the imagery group had a 74% mean reduction of bingeing and a 73% reduction of vomiting. The imagery treatment also demonstrated improvement in attitudes about eating, dieting and body weight in comparison to the control group. In addition, the guided imagery group demonstrated improvement on psychological measures of aloneness and the ability for self-comforting. The study concludes that guided imagery is an effective treatment for bulimia nervosa, at least in the short-term.</p>

            <h3>Cancer - influencing survival</h3>
            <p>Dean Schrock, Raymond Palmer and Bonnie Taylor looked at the effects of a 6 week psychosocial intervention group on the survival of 21 breast cancer and 29 prostate cancer patients in rural Pennsylvania.
                <br>The 6 2-hour class topics emphasized imagery and stress reduction techniques, along with covering attitudes, feelings, self-esteem, spirituality, nutrition and exercise. The intervention group lived significantly longer than the matched controls, suggesting that short-term psychosocial interventions that encourage the expression of feeling, provide social support and teach coping skills can influence survival. But Self-selection for these groups could have biased this sample.</p>
            <p id="source-quote">Article reference: Schrock D, Palmer R, Taylor B. Alternative Therapies in Health &amp; Medicine, May, 1999; Vol 5, #3:49-55.</p>
            <h3>Cancer - immune response and quality of life</h3>
            <p>Blair Justice, Mary Ann Richardson and their cohorts at the University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health, conducted a pilot study to differentiate the effects of imagery vs. support on coping, attitude, immune function and emotional well-being after breast cancer. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: standard care, weekly support (for 6 weeks) or imagery sessions (for 6 weeks).
                <br>For all women, immune function increased, quality of life improved and natural killer activity remained unchanged. Both of the intervention groups showed better coping skills than the standard care group. And the imagery group had less stress, more vigor and better quality of life than the support group.
                <br>The just-begun University of Vermont study cited below was designed to follow up on this study and expand upon it further.</p>

            <h3>Cancer - increasing comfort and reducing anxiety</h3>
            <p>Katherine Kolcaba, PhD, RN (U of Akron) and Christine Fox, PhD, (U of Toledo) found guided imagery to be an effective intervention for increasing comfort and reducing anxiety in 53 women with early stage breast cancer undergoing Radiation Therapy. The investigators designed and recorded imagery specifically for this study. Subjects were most likely to listen just before a treatment.</p>
