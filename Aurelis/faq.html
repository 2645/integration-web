            <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><div class="question">What is the best attitude for using Aurelis?</div><div class="answer">That is indeed an interesting way to proceed. Aurelis is only an instrument to reach autosuggestive self-help. Don’t feel obliged to continue listening in an attempt ‘to use it as well as possible’. If you feel that you can do a session equally well without listening to it, then it is valuable to do it also this way. It actually depends upon you.
On the other hand, if you think that listening remains important to you, then that is of course also the case. For most people it is not easy to work quite as effectively without aid of the voice. I would then only want to ask you to avoid the feeling of dependence. That is not the intention of the whole Aurelis project. You are central in your own healing. Aurelis is at best a good and temporary aid in this.

If you know several techniques quite well, then you can combine them with each other in one self-made session. I have already more than once experienced myself that this is really very effective, for instance in the case of acute violent pain.

If you feel yourself helped, then it is meaningful to repeat a session once more from time up to time, at yourself, or while listening to Aurelis. Then this last is of course interesting if meanwhile you have somewhat forgotten what a session is really about. A good quality of symbolism is very important to reach your own subconscious in a good way.</div></li>
