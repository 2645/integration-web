            <h2>About Autosuggestion</h2>
            <p>The subconscious is not something we can hold or describe in detail. It is constantly moving and irrefutably active. Without this continuous functioning of the subconscious we would come to a standstill as a computer without electrical supply. We are also indebted to the subconscious that we stay in reasonably good health.
                <br>By means of autosuggestion we communicate with our subconscious. Although this is what we do all day long, we feel something lacking. Modern man has lost the contact with his subconscious for a major part. This is the cause to many problems, as illustrated by psychosomatics. It is of utmost importance that we learn to use suggestion to improve the contact with our own subconscious.</p>

            <h2>Apply Autosuggestion</h2>
            <p>To use autosuggestion correctly, it should be clearly distinguished from superficial positive thinking. With the latter you try to force yourself to particular thoughts from the outside. This could lead to negative consequences. With autosuggestion you come in contact with your complete self, as a result of which the change happens from within and will be more efficient and durable. Autosuggestion can become even more effective, if you bring about a combination of relaxation, concentration and motivation in yourself. Cognitive strategies are thought techniques that enable you to aim suggestions at a target more efficiently. They are sometimes used spontaneously. With AURELIS you can learn to apply a select number of these techniques in various domains.</p>
