            <h2>About Autosuggestion</h2>
            <p>The subconscious is not something we can hold or describe in detail. It is constantly moving and irrefutably active. Without this continuous functioning of the subconscious we would come to a standstill as a computer without electrical supply. We are also indebted to the subconscious that we stay in reasonably good health.
                <br>By means of autosuggestion we communicate with our subconscious. Although this is what we do all day long, we feel something lacking. Modern man has lost the contact with his subconscious for a major part. This is the cause to many problems, as illustrated by psychosomatics. It is of utmost importance that we learn to use suggestion to improve the contact with our own subconscious.

            <h2>Apply Autosuggestion</h2>
            <p>To use autosuggestion correctly, it should be clearly distinguished from superficial positive thinking. With the latter you try to force yourself to particular thoughts from the outside. This could lead to negative consequences. With autosuggestion you come in contact with your complete self, as a result of which the change happens from within and will be more efficient and durable. Autosuggestion can become even more effective, if you bring about a combination of relaxation, concentration and motivation in yourself. Cognitive strategies are thought techniques that enable you to aim suggestions at a target more efficiently. They are sometimes used spontaneously. With AURELIS you can learn to apply a select number of these techniques in various domains.</p>

                <h2>The use of visualization and metaphors</h2>
                <p>Visualization is frequently applied in sports, but in fact everyone can put it to good use. If you have (too) little imaginary capabilities, it can be improved with some practice. Visualization can be used for your own health, as a means of self-care. However, it is not a magic remedy. If you cannot manage to visualize, there is no need to panic. Visualization is just one way of having the power of metaphors work for you. A metaphor in its turn is only one way of applying autosuggestion. Through metaphors you can start a dialogue with your subconscious. As a metaphor speaks a very foreign language, it cannot be translated or understood just like that. This is not at all needed in order to be effective.</p>

                <a name="relaxation"></a>
                <h2>Relaxation</h2>
                <p>Many people in western countries are tense all the time and therefore do not know what a state of relaxation feels like. They are no longer aware of their tension. A very deep relaxation is rare in the West and very difficult to attain. Most western people do not think it worthwhile. Regular sessions (via yoga, Tai Chi, massage) in which one can attain a reasonably deep relaxation offer many advantages in the short term (weeks, months) as well as in the long run (after many years). In the short term, relaxation promotes well being, lessens symptoms such as pain, and is a good starting point in order to work with autosuggestion. In the long run, it lowers the chances for serious illness. The degree to which these chances diminish, is (still) difficult to determine on a scientific base. A number of problems that come with deep relaxation are mostly easy to manage.

                <a name="placebo"></a>
                <h2>Placebo: The Pill of the Quack</h2>
                <p>The placebo effect is the effect that any medical therapy can have and that is not accomplished through its own physical action, but through the suggestion that it may have such an action. Therefore any placebo effect is proof of the psychological power that an individual can use in order to become and to stay healthy. Under the right circumstances, everybody is sensitive to the placebo effect. The contribution of placebo to present-day western medication is between 20 and 80 percent of the total action (this is: of the difference that a person experiences after taking the medication versus what the same person would experience when taking no medication at all. This effect is proven in thousands of double blind studies. However, placebo is not deliberately used as such in western medicine. The conscious use of a placebo presupposes that the patient is being led astray one way or the other. On the other hand, autosuggestion is a means to attain the placebo effect without the deceit that is inherent to placebo.</p>

                <a name="prayer"></a>
                <h2>The Power Of Prayer As Autosuggestion</h2>
                <p>In all times and cultures, prayer has been used as a means to influence the own health or that of a beloved person. Prayer can be seen as one method to use autosuggestion. Characteristics of efficient autosuggestion are very much in line with the characteristics of a good prayer. This vision on prayer has no implications for its intrinsic value. The place of pilgrimage Lourdes is a good example of how closely prayer and autosuggestion are related to each other. Faith is a good method to gain better health, but behind that faith lays the same power as autosuggestion. It is not necessary to be a religious believer in order to be able to use that power.</p>

                <h2>Learn To Listen To Your Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Most medications are purely symptomatic. They only alleviate symptoms, without any influence on the causes of illness. Therefore it is &#39;nature&#39; or the patient himself that in the meantime leads to the cure/healing. A purely symptomatic mode of treatment ignores the importance of the symptom as a message. This message can however be very important to the health in the short and in the long run. A symptom is, like all communication from the subconscious, not translatable as such. In order to properly receive the message, one first has to accept the symptom as a message. With the use of autosuggestion, for instance in the manner of a visualization, one can enter into a dialogue with the symptom. &#39;Insight&#39; in the meaning of the symptom is much less important than a proper living experience of it. Nobody can give you this living experience. It has to emerge from your deeper self.</p>

                <a name="suggestion"></a>
                <h2>Suggestion Is More Powerful Than The Will</h2>
                <p>In western culture, will power is regarded as a huge virtue. However, there are different kinds of will power, based either on a neurotic suppression of desires or based on an integration of them. If suggestion confronts will power, the latter has no chance. A good example of this is the following: in trying to fall asleep, one cannot command oneself to sleep. It has to come spontaneously. Lots of problems that are tackled with pure will power can be solved much better with the use of suggestion.</p>

                <a name="patientAsCure"></a>
                <h2>The Patient As Cure</h2>
                <p>In medicine as well as in psychology, there is a growing attention for the bi-directional influence between mind and body. This has translated itself among others in distinct specializations. A lot of scientific research proves the huge psychological influence on many bodily processes. However, this knowledge reaches many physicians only with great difficulty. Apart from the already proven influences, there are still very many possibilities. The scientific methods of investigation that medicine has developed until now are very appropriate for disentangling the physical causes of illness, but much less for the psychological causes. While giving more attention to the psyche, very probably a lot more psychological power will be scientifically proven.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, people look for cures and tools that hold the promise of a better use of their own psychological powers. Alternative medicine does not always come up with an answer worthy of its promises. In the end, through the explicit use of autosuggestion, people will be able to take more responsibility for their own illness and health. In no case may this lead to feelings of guilt.
