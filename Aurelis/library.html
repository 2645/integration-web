            <h2>Preliminary remark</h2>
            <p>These MiniTexts are organised into subdomains. Each of these contains +/- texts. Each text is written in a way that your own subconscious (‘deeper self’) is transformed into your best friend. Never do the texts lead you to an aggressive fight against yourself. These texts can effectively help you in communicating with your own deeper self, but this does not happen automatically. You yourself have to DO something with the texts. You have to let their meaning-for-you touch you as deeply as possible. Whether the texts really help you depends primarily on yourself. This takes some will power, but never engenders any aggression against yourself.</p>
            <h2>Directions for use</h2>
            <p>The effectiveness of the texts does not come from merely reading them, but from thinking them over and feeling them deep inside yourself. Reading too quickly impedes this. The reading is minimal. Take care that the doing is maximal.</p>
