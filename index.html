                <h2>About Aurelis</h2>
                AURELIS: AUtosuggestion RELaxation Inner Strength is a project (see project modules) that aims to provide anyone with the power to use more of his or her inner-mind possibilities. This is done through:
                <ul>
                    <li>Autosuggestion: the ability to communicate with the inner mind (the vast neuronal network of the brain that produces much more than consciousness), in any possible way, with goals that are pertinent to the person as a whole.</li>
                    <li>Relaxation: making a person act more as a whole, instead of being divided into competing parts. Thus: relaxing the struggle, diminishing agressive energy.</li>
                    <li>Inner strength: the ability to accomplish specific goals.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="regText">
                <h2>Why Aurelis</h2>
                <bold>The purpose of the AURELIS project is to use autosuggestion as a means to communicate with the subconscious and to direct its tremendous power in order to gain better health and well being.</bold>
                <br>
                <br>AURELIS is thereby centered on an ongoing (r)evolution in medicine. It brings together several needs and possibilities that both have multiplied in importance worldwide during the last decennia. Namely:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the need for a really strong answer to the burgeoning amount of psychosomatic illness and addictions</li>
                    <li>
                        the need for self-care</li>
                    <li>
                        the possibility of transgressing into a new medical way of thinking, that is consistent with the scientific principles of the present one</li>
                    <li>
                        an advanced use of informatics, remaining within the range of widely available hardware.</li>
                </ul>
                Medicine has never been a once-and-for-all science. It continually evolves and regularly undergoes a paradigm shift. The'regular' medicine as we know it at this turn of the 21st century, is in fact still very young and probing. For instance: nearly all medications prescribed before World War II were -as shown in retrospect- pure placebos without any directly positive physical action. Yet these medications were efficient because they carried the expectation / belief of cure. Moreover, it is a scientific fact that most of the medications of today have a placebo-effect of 40% or more, sometimes even 80% (as in the case of many antidepressants). These numbers are of course much higher than most people are aware of. This has led some of the most insightful thinkers to the following lamentation:

                If everything were known about the etiology of the placebo effect, the terms placebo and placebo effect would disappear and be replaced by a hugely powerful megapsychotherapy.
